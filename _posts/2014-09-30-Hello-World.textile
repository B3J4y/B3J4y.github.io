Hello World,
This is my first post in this Blog. I am Jan, 25 years old and mainly I am studying Informatik. I am not that kind of person who is totally into computer sience and pretty confident with a specific programming language. I use programm languages mostly to do my Jobs. Therefor I learn a lot about programming and get a good overview about Software Engeneering.
This Blog should be a little treasure for my experience. If I learn something try to put everything together and post it to this Blog. I don't know if anybody is interested but this could be helpful for me.
So far,
Jan
